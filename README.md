# Astro-API

A small API &amp; React app implementation based on the Astroneer game, created for OUR JavaScript course.
And here is the specification of the project: [Astro-API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbYYzY0j7Xq8KX8a2ei2_Ta1AQUWpfcpD0tORZt8AD4).

## Run

- Clone the repository
- Create an `.env` file with `cp .env.example .env`
  - No need to change anything actually
- You can setup it by yourself or **just run `npm run setup`**
