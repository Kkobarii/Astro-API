# Astro-API

A small API &amp; React app implementation based on the Astroneer game, created for OUR JavaScript course.
And here is the specification of the project: [Astro-API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbYYzY0j7Xq8KX8a2ei2_Ta1AQUWpfcpD0tORZt8AD4).

Forntend is actually written in Typescript React and backend in Javascript (I forgot to setup it in typescript)

## Run

- Clone the repository
- Create an `.env` file with `cp .env.example .env`
  - No need to change anything actually
- You can setup it by yourself or **just run `npm run setup`**, no other work needed for frontend or backend
  - After that you could write
    - `npm run be` to start backend
    - `npm run fe` to start frontend
- **Pro tip**: If you want to edit anything, after work just run prettier. For example with `prettier --write .` or with `npx prettier --write .` so everyting will be nicely formatted ðŸ˜Š

### Backend

- First, install dependencies with `npm i`

- For first build, you have to setup prisma
  - Install prisma with `npm i prisma --save-dev` (you don't have to you already have it)
  - Run `npm run migrate` to create the database
  - Then, run `npm run seed` to insert some test data
- Working with the database
  - To update the schema, run `npm run migrate`
  - Optionally, run `npx prisma studio` to open the prisma studio
- **Run dev**: `npm run be`

### Frontend

- Change directory into the `fe` directory with `cd fe`
- First, install dependencies with `npm i`
- And now you can run the react app
  - **Run dev**: `npm start` in the `fe` directory (you should be there)

### TODO

**Back-end (NodeJS):**
